## The 30-second pitch

You finish a feature. You type `git commit`. That's where DevTrack wakes up.

It refines your commit message with AI, asks how long the work took, opens a split-pane picker so you can link to an open issue in one keypress, posts a comment on that issue, and offers to push — all before you've left the terminal. When the session ends, it generates an EOD report in your own writing style, learned from your Teams messages.

The Go daemon is a 5 MB binary. The Python backend runs as a subprocess. Nothing leaves your machine unless you want it to.

## The core loop

```
You type: git commit -m "fix auth redirect"
                │
                ▼
        DevTrack intercepts
                │
          ┌─────┴─────┐
          │  AI refines │  → Accept / Enhance / Regenerate
          └─────┬─────┘
                │
        "Log this work? (y/n)"
                │
        "How long? (e.g. 2h, 30m)"
                │
        ┌────────────────┐
        │  Ticket picker  │  ↑/↓ to browse · / to filter · Enter to link
        │  (split pane)   │
        └────────┬───────┘
                 │
        Comment posted on issue
        Commit hash attached
                 │
        "Push to origin/branch? (y/n)"
```

Shell setup is one line, done once:

```bash
eval "$(devtrack shell-init)"    # add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
devtrack enable-git              # opt this repo in
```

After that, `git commit` routes through DevTrack automatically for monitored repos. Everything else (`git push`, `git pull`, `git status`) goes straight to real git, unmodified. Escape hatch: `GIT_NO_DEVTRACK=1 git commit -m "skip"`.

> AI commit enhancement is only active when the daemon is running. If you stop it, `git commit` passes through with zero delay and no errors.

## Key features

### Multi-repo monitoring

```yaml
# workspaces.yaml
workspaces:
  - name: work-api
    path: ~/work/api
    pm_platform: azure
    pm_assignee: jane@example.com
    pm_iteration_path: "MyProject\\Sprint 5"
    pm_area_path: "MyProject\\Backend"
  - name: oss-lib
    path: ~/oss/my-lib
    pm_platform: github
    pm_milestone: 3
```

Per-workspace PM overrides (`pm_assignee`, `pm_iteration_path`, `pm_area_path`, `pm_milestone`) are applied when DevTrack creates work items or issues for that repo — Azure uses `assigned_to`/`area_path`/`iteration_path`, GitHub/GitLab use `assignees` and `milestone`. Omit any field to use the global default.

```bash
devtrack workspace list
devtrack workspace add my-project ~/code/project --pm github
devtrack workspace install-hooks   # push post-commit hooks to all enabled workspaces
```

### Work session tracking

```bash
devtrack work start AUTH-42    # start timing a ticket
devtrack work stop             # auto-measures duration
devtrack work report           # EOD narrative in terminal
devtrack work report --email me@org.com
```

Every `git commit` while a session is active automatically attaches its hash — no manual logging.

### git-sage — local LLM git agent

![git-sage standup demo](wiki/assets/standup-demo.gif)

```bash
uv run python -m backend.git_sage do "squash my last 5 commits"
uv run python -m backend.git_sage ask "how do I rebase onto main?"
```

Runs an agentic loop: plans operations, executes them, reads output, handles failures with rollback, only asks when genuinely ambiguous. Session approval dialog (auto / review / suggest-only), step history, and interactive undo built in.

### Personalized AI ("Talk Like You")

```bash
devtrack enable-learning        # opt in — learns from Teams messages
devtrack show-profile           # view your inferred writing style
devtrack test-response "Completed auth module"
```

Combines a style profile with ChromaDB RAG (actual examples of how you write) to personalize every commit message, work update, and report the system generates.

### Ticket alerter

```bash
devtrack alerts                 # unread notifications (last 24 h)
devtrack alerts --all
devtrack alerts --clear
```

Background poller watches **GitHub**, **Azure DevOps**, **Jira**, and **GitLab** for assigned issues, new comments, review requests, and status changes. Delivers macOS OS notifications and terminal output.

- **GitHub**: Issue/PR assigned, review requested, comment on involved issue
- **Azure DevOps**: Work item assigned, comment added, state changed
- **Jira**: Assigned to you, new comments, status transitions (via REST API)
- **GitLab**: Issue assigned, new notes (comments), merge request review requested (`ALERT_GITLAB_ENABLED=true`)

Alert state (`last_checked` timestamps per source) persists to **SQLite** when MongoDB is unavailable, so poll continuity survives daemon restarts even without a MongoDB connection.

### AI project planning (via Telegram)

```
/plan Build a payment processing system
→ Decomposes into Epic + Stories + Tasks
→ Creates everything in Azure / GitLab / GitHub

/newproject
→ Pick platform · Enter requirements + deadline
→ AI fetches team workload · Generates sprint YAML
→ PM approves via email link · Sprints created with dependencies
```

### Auto-start at login

One command installs the right service for your OS — no manual plist or unit file editing:

```bash
devtrack autostart-install    # macOS → launchd LaunchAgent
                              # Linux/systemd → ~/.config/systemd/user/devtrack.service
                              # WSL without systemd → shell profile block
devtrack autostart-status     # show current auto-start status
devtrack autostart-uninstall  # remove auto-start
```

All current `.env` variables are baked into the service file at install time so the daemon starts with the correct environment even in a login session without a shell profile. Re-run `autostart-install` after changing `.env`.

### Post-commit hooks for all workspaces

```bash
devtrack workspace install-hooks    # install post-commit hook in every enabled workspace
```

Normally DevTrack installs hooks when the daemon starts. Use this command to push hooks to all workspaces at once — useful after adding new repos to `workspaces.yaml`.

### Webhook + Trigger server (HTTP mode)

The Go daemon spawns `backend.webhook_server` as a subprocess in the default managed mode. In external/Docker mode the server runs separately and the Go daemon connects to it over HTTPS. Either way the same FastAPI server handles both:

- **Inbound webhooks** from Azure DevOps, GitHub, GitLab, and Jira at `/webhooks/<source>`
- **Outbound triggers** from the Go daemon at `/trigger/commit` and `/trigger/timer`

```bash
# external/Docker mode only — managed mode starts this automatically
python -m backend.webhook_server
```

All trigger endpoints require the `X-DevTrack-API-Key` header (set `DEVTRACK_API_KEY` in `.env`). Webhook signature verification uses source-specific secrets (`AZURE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, etc.). GitLab webhooks are registered automatically at startup when `GITLAB_WEBHOOK_URL` is configured.

### AI development agents (Claude Code)

DevTrack ships three Claude Code sub-agents that automate the project's own development workflow. They are invoked inside Claude Code sessions, not from the terminal.

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| **project-vision** | PM agent — breaks plans into tasks, writes the project board (`Data/agent_logs/project_board.md`), dispatches the engineer, enforces no-push-to-main and vision alignment, fires docu-agent after major features |
| **devtrack-engineer** | Engineer agent — always works on a task branch, commits exclusively through `devtrack git commit`, logs every commit to `Data/agent_logs/engineer_log.md`, opens a PR on completion, never pushes directly to `main` |
| **post-generator** | Turns the weekly engineer log into draft dev.to, Hacker News, and LinkedIn posts saved under `Data/agent_logs/posts/` |

Invoke from a Claude Code session:

```
/project-vision   # plan a new phase or ask for status
/devtrack-engineer  # dispatch the engineer on the current board task
/post-generator   # generate this week's posts from the engineer log
```

The PM and engineer agents share `Data/agent_logs/project_board.md` as a contract — PM writes tasks, engineer reads and updates status. All agent activity is captured in `Data/agent_logs/engineer_log.md`.

### Anonymous telemetry

DevTrack sends an anonymous install and daily-active ping (no code, no commit text, no personal data). To opt out:

```bash
devtrack telemetry off      # disable all pings
devtrack telemetry on       # re-enable
devtrack telemetry status   # show current setting
```

The ping sends: a random install UUID, a hashed hardware fingerprint, the event type (`install` / `active`), OS, arch, and version. Nothing else leaves your machine.

### Admin console (CS-3)

A browser-based admin console built with FastAPI + HTMX. Start it with:

```bash
devtrack admin-start       # web admin console at localhost:8090/admin/
```

Sign in with `ADMIN_USERNAME` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (set in `.env`). The dashboard shows live trigger-activity stats (triggers today, commits today, last trigger time, errors in the last 24 h) that refresh every 30 seconds via HTMX without a full page reload.

**Pages and capabilities:**

| Page | What you can do |
|------|----------------|
| **Dashboard** | Health overview, trigger throughput stats, quick links |
| **Users** | Create/delete users, change roles (`admin` / `viewer`), disable/enable accounts, reset passwords |
| **API Keys** | Generate and revoke per-user API keys |
| **License** | View current license tier, seat count, and terms acceptance status |
| **Server** | Real-time process table (CPU %, memory, health) with restart/stop/start controls |
| **Audit Log** | Full history of all admin actions |

**Single-process mode (`ADMIN_EMBED`):** By default the admin console runs as a separate process on `ADMIN_PORT` (default `8090`). Set `ADMIN_EMBED=true` to mount the admin router directly on the main webhook server at `/admin` — no extra port, no extra process:

```bash
# .env
ADMIN_EMBED=true          # mount admin at /admin on the webhook server (port 8089)
# or leave false (default) to run on a dedicated port:
ADMIN_PORT=8090
```

**Required `.env` keys for the admin console:**

```bash
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=changeme          # plain text (dev) or bcrypt hash ($2b$...)
ADMIN_SECRET_KEY=<random-string> # JWT signing key — generate with: openssl rand -hex 32
ADMIN_PORT=8090                  # ignored when ADMIN_EMBED=true
ADMIN_EMBED=false
```

### Server management

```bash
devtrack server-tui    # live process monitor — CPU%, memory, health + trigger throughput stats
devtrack tui           # full-screen dashboard: overview, activity, workspaces, alerts
```

The `server-tui` panel includes a **trigger throughput stats** pane that reads directly from the SQLite database and shows triggers fired today, commits today, last trigger time (HH:MM), and unprocessed-trigger error count for the last 24 hours. The pane degrades gracefully — it displays zeroes rather than crashing if the database is unavailable.

## Deployment modes

| Mode | How | Use case |
|------|-----|----------|
| **Managed** (default) | Daemon spawns Python automatically | Local dev |
| **External** | `DEVTRACK_SERVER_URL=http://host:port` | Docker / self-hosted backend |
| **Cloud** | `devtrack cloud login --url URL --key KEY` | Remote managed backend |

```bash
docker compose up -d   # starts Python backend + MongoDB, Redis, PostgreSQL
```

## Testing

```bash
cd devtrack-bin && go test ./...                    # Go layer (20+ tests)
uv run pytest backend/tests/                        # Python backend (492+ tests)
uv run pytest backend/tests/ -k cs1                # CS-1 HTTP trigger suite (28 tests)
uv run pytest backend/tests/test_server_tui.py     # server_tui helpers (37 headless tests)
uv run pytest backend/tests/test_admin_auth.py     # admin auth (19 tests)
uv run pytest backend/tests/test_admin_routes.py   # admin console routes (59+ tests)
uv run pytest backend/tests/test_admin_user_manager.py  # user manager (33+ tests)
uv run pytest backend/tests/test_jira_alerter.py   # Jira alerter (26 tests)
```

The CS-2 config audit enforces that **no Python business-logic module calls `os.getenv()` directly** — all 40+ backend modules were audited (TASK-001 through TASK-007) and now route through `backend.config` typed accessors. Missing required env vars produce a `ConfigError` with the exact variable name rather than a silent `None`.

---

## Privacy

All data stays on your machine. Ollama runs locally. External AI services (OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq) are optional — only prompt text is sent, never commit history or personal context. Learning from Teams requires explicit opt-in and can be deleted at any time with `devtrack learning-reset`.

---

## License

DevTrack Community License — free for personal use and teams up to 10 users. Enterprise (11+ users) requires a paid license.

```bash
devtrack terms          # read the terms
devtrack terms --accept # accept non-interactively (e.g. in CI)
```
