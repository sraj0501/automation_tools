# Project Guide: Automated Developer Timesheet and Progress Reporting CLI Tool

## Project Overview
**Project Name**: DevTrack CLI (placeholder name)  
**Objective**: Build a non-intrusive, intelligent CLI tool that runs in the background, prompts developers periodically or on Git commits to log their work, updates project management systems automatically, and generates end-of-day summaries to streamline timesheet and progress reporting.

**Purpose**: Address the pain point of developers struggling with manual timesheet and status reporting by automating task tracking, integrating with project management systems, and minimizing workflow disruption.

**Technology Stack**:
- **Go**: For the lightweight, always-running background process, Git integration, and system monitoring.
- **Python**: For intelligent processing (NLP, API integrations, user prompts).
- **Communication**: IPC (e.g., sockets, pipes) or lightweight HTTP server for Go-Python interaction.
- **Storage**: SQLite for local caching and logging.
- **Configuration**: YAML or JSON for user settings.

**Target Audience**: Developers and teams using Git and project management tools (e.g., Jira, GitHub Issues, Trello) who need to log time or report progress regularly.

## Goals and Features
### Core Features
1. **Background Monitoring**:
   - Run as a lightweight daemon process to monitor developer activity without impacting system performance.
   - Trigger prompts based on:
     - Time intervals (every 3 hours, configurable).
     - Git commits (detected via Git hooks or repository polling).
2. **Non-Intrusive Prompts**:
   - Display minimal, context-aware prompts asking developers to specify the project and task details for their work or commit.
   - Support quick responses (e.g., dropdowns, predefined options) and natural language input.
   - Allow skipping or deferring prompts with a mechanism to revisit later.
3. **Context Awareness**:
   - Infer project/task details from Git repository, branch, or edited files.
   - Suggest relevant tickets or projects based on commit messages or file patterns.
4. **Project Management Integration**:
   - Connect to tools like Jira, GitHub Issues, or Trello via APIs to fetch task details and update statuses.
   - Map developer responses to specific tickets/issues and post updates automatically.
5. **End-of-Day Summary**:
   - Compile a daily report of all logged activities (projects, tasks, time estimates).
   - Present the summary for user review and edits via CLI or a temporary file in their preferred editor.
   - Push final updates to project management systems and optionally send emails to stakeholders.
6. **Intelligent Processing**:
   - Use NLP to parse free-text responses and extract project names, ticket numbers, or task descriptions.
   - Improve suggestions over time (e.g., learning repository-to-project mappings).
7. **Configuration**:
   - Allow users to define projects, repositories, API credentials, and prompt schedules in a configuration file (YAML/JSON).
8. **Offline Support**:
   - Cache data locally to support offline work, syncing updates when connectivity is restored.

### Non-Functional Goals
- **Performance**: Minimal CPU/memory usage, especially for the background process.
- **Usability**: Non-intrusive prompts and intuitive configuration to ensure developer adoption.
- **Security**: Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., API keys) and avoid storing plain-text credentials.
- **Cross-Platform**: Support Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Extensibility**: Modular design to support new project management systems or custom workflows via plugins.

## Architecture Overview
The tool is split into two main components leveraging the strengths of Go and Python:

1. **Go Core (Background Engine)**:
   - **Purpose**: Manages system-level tasks, monitoring, and triggers.
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Run as a daemon process to monitor Git repositories and system clock.
     - Detect `git commit` events using Git hooks or polling.
     - Schedule time-based prompts (e.g., every 3 hours).
     - Communicate with the Python layer to initiate prompts or process data.
   - **Why Go**: Lightweight, fast, and compiles to a single binary, ideal for always-on background processes.

2. **Python Intelligence Layer (Logic and Integrations)**:
   - **Purpose**: Handles user interactions, intelligent processing, and external integrations.
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Generate and display prompts with context-aware suggestions.
     - Parse user responses using NLP to extract task details.
     - Integrate with project management APIs to fetch and update data.
     - Compile and present end-of-day summaries.
   - **Why Python**: Rich ecosystem for NLP (e.g., `spaCy`, `transformers`), API interactions (`requests`), and rapid development.

3. **Communication Mechanism**:
   - Use IPC (e.g., Unix sockets, named pipes) or a lightweight HTTP server (Python’s `Flask`) for Go to trigger Python actions.
   - Example: Go detects a commit, sends a JSON payload with repo details to Python, which responds with a prompt and processes the user’s input.

4. **Local Storage**:
   - Use SQLite to store:
     - Prompt responses and their mappings to projects/tickets.
     - Logs of triggers and API updates for auditing.
     - Cached data for offline operation.
   - Go handles trigger-related writes, Python handles reads and updates.

5. **Configuration**:
   - A single YAML/JSON file (e.g., `~/.devtrack/config.yaml`) defines:
     - Project-to-repository mappings.
     - API credentials for project management systems.
     - Prompt schedules and user preferences.

## Implementation Strategy
### Phase 1: Prototype (Python-First)
- **Goal**: Validate core functionality with a Python-only prototype to iterate quickly.
- **Steps**:
  1. Implement basic Git commit detection using `GitPython`.
  2. Create a simple CLI prompt system to ask for project/task details.
  3. Integrate with one project management system (e.g., GitHub Issues) using `requests`.
  4. Develop basic NLP parsing (e.g., using `spaCy`) to extract ticket numbers and tasks from responses.
  5. Generate a simple end-of-day summary and allow edits via CLI.
- **Deliverable**: A working Python script that handles prompts, Git integration, and API updates for one platform.

### Phase 2: Add Go Core
- **Goal**: Introduce the Go-based background process for performance and reliability.
- **Steps**:
  1. Implement a Go daemon to monitor Git repositories (using `go-git` or Git hooks) and system clock.
  2. Set up IPC (e.g., Unix sockets) for Go to trigger Python scripts.
  3. Move trigger logic (time-based and Git-based) to Go, keeping Python for prompts and integrations.
  4. Test cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- **Deliverable**: A hybrid system where Go handles triggers and Python handles logic.

### Phase 3: Enhance Intelligence and Integrations
- **Goal**: Add advanced features and polish the tool.
- **Steps**:
  1. Improve NLP with machine learning (e.g., fine-tune suggestions using `transformers`).
  2. Add support for multiple project management systems (e.g., Jira, Trello).
  3. Implement offline caching and syncing using SQLite.
  4. Add email notifications for end-of-day summaries.
  5. Create a configuration wizard to simplify setup.
- **Deliverable**: A feature-complete tool with robust integrations and intelligent features.

### Phase 4: Optimization and Deployment
- **Goal**: Optimize performance and prepare for distribution.
- **Steps**:
  1. Profile and optimize Go for minimal resource usage.
  2. Bundle Python dependencies (e.g., via `PyInstaller`) or containerize for consistent deployment.
  3. Create installation scripts for easy setup across platforms.
  4. Add plugin support for custom project management integrations.
- **Deliverable**: A production-ready tool packaged as a single installable unit.

## Key Considerations
### Usability
- **Non-Intrusive Design**: Prompts should be concise, skippable, and deferrable to avoid disrupting workflow.
- **Intuitive Setup**: Provide a configuration wizard or default settings to minimize onboarding effort.
- **Feedback Loop**: Allow users to pause/resume the tool or adjust prompt frequency via CLI commands (e.g., `devtrack pause`, `devtrack set-interval 4h`).

### Performance
- **Go Core**: Ensure the daemon uses minimal CPU/memory (target <10 MB RAM, <1% CPU).
- **Python Layer**: Optimize NLP and API calls to avoid latency (e.g., cache API responses, use lightweight NLP models).
- **Lazy Loading**: Only invoke Python when needed to reduce resource usage.

### Security
- **Encryption**: Store API keys and sensitive data encrypted in the configuration file or system keychain.
- **Data Privacy**: Avoid logging sensitive information (e.g., commit messages) without user consent.
- **Secure APIs**: Use HTTPS and OAuth for project management integrations.

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Test on Windows, macOS, and Linux to ensure Git hooks, file system monitoring, and prompts work consistently.
- Handle platform-specific quirks (e.g., Windows file paths, Linux permissions).

### Extensibility
- Design modular APIs in Python for adding new project management integrations.
- Support plugins (e.g., Python scripts) for custom workflows or additional features.

## Edge Cases
1. **No Git Repository**: If the developer is working outside a Git repo, prompt for manual project input or skip gracefully.
2. **Failed API Calls**: Cache updates locally and retry when connectivity is restored.
3. **Ambiguous Context**: If the tool can’t infer the project (e.g., multiple projects in one repo), offer a dropdown or fallback to manual selection.
4. **Skipped Prompts**: Store skipped prompts and revisit them at the end of the day or next trigger.
5. **Long-Running Tasks**: Avoid prompting during focused coding sessions (e.g., detect IDE activity or keyboard input).
6. **Multiple Repositories**: Handle cases where a developer switches between repos by maintaining context per repo.
7. **Offline Mode**: Cache all data locally and sync when online, ensuring no data loss.
8. **Conflicting Configurations**: Validate the configuration file to prevent errors (e.g., duplicate project names).
9. **Time Zone Issues**: Use system time zone for scheduling prompts and summaries, with an option to override.
10. **Large Teams**: Ensure the tool scales for team use, potentially syncing data to a central server for reporting.

## Potential Challenges
1. **Adoption Resistance**:
   - **Problem**: Developers may resist a new tool due to added complexity.
   - **Solution**: Emphasize ease of use, minimal setup, and tangible benefits (e.g., time saved on timesheets).
2. **Accuracy of Context Inference**:
   - **Problem**: Inferring projects or tickets from commits/files may lead to errors.
   - **Solution**: Allow user overrides and improve suggestions over time with machine learning.
3. **Integration Complexity**:
   - **Problem**: Supporting multiple project management systems requires robust API handling.
   - **Solution**: Start with one system (e.g., GitHub Issues), then modularize for extensibility.
4. **Resource Usage**:
   - **Problem**: Background processes or NLP could consume significant resources.
   - **Solution**: Optimize Go for low resource usage and invoke Python only when needed.
5. **Two-Language Overhead**:
   - **Problem**: Managing Go and Python adds development and maintenance complexity.
   - **Solution**: Keep communication simple (e.g., JSON over IPC) and document interactions clearly.
