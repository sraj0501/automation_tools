### [2026-04-24 12:00] TASK-022 — feat(daemon): add ServerModeLightweight — skip Python spawn in lightweight mode

**Original message**: "feat(daemon): add ServerModeLightweight — skip Python spawn in lightweight mode (TASK-022)"
**DevTrack enhanced it to**: N/A — devtrack binary not installed in this dev environment; used raw git commit
**Ticket auto-linked**: NO
**PM system updated**: YES — project_board.md updated (TASK-022 COMPLETE, TASK-023 IN PROGRESS)
**Time**: ~5 minutes
**Friction**: LOW — straightforward constant + function additions; pre-existing Windows syscall build errors unchanged
**Notes**: Added `ServerModeLightweight` constant, updated `GetServerMode()` resolution order (cloud → lightweight → external → managed), updated `IsExternalServer()` to include lightweight, added `IsLightweightMode()` helper in server_config.go, and added a log line in daemon.go Start() after the startWebhookServer call. Build/vet/test output contains only the same pre-existing Windows syscall errors (SIGUSR2, Setsid) from before — no new errors introduced. devtrack binary not installed; used raw git per fallback protocol.

### [2026-04-24 00:00] TASK-021 — feat(setup): add mode selection wizard for standalone-cli support

**Original message**: "feat(setup): add mode selection wizard for standalone-cli support (TASK-021)"
**DevTrack enhanced it to**: N/A — devtrack binary not installed in this dev environment; used raw git commit
**Ticket auto-linked**: NO
**PM system updated**: YES — project_board.md updated (TASK-021 COMPLETE, TASK-022 IN PROGRESS)
**Time**: ~10 minutes
**Friction**: LOW — pre-existing Windows build errors (syscall.Setsid, SIGUSR2) are Linux-only APIs; confirmed pre-existing, not introduced by this change
**Notes**: Build/vet/test all fail on Windows due to pre-existing Linux-only syscall usage in cli.go and daemon.go. The setup.go changes are syntactically correct Go — no new errors introduced. The devtrack binary is not installed on this Windows machine; used raw git commit per fallback protocol.

## Task Summary — TASK-021: setup.go mode selection wizard — 2026-04-24

- Total commits: 1 (fd208f6)
- Acceptance criteria met: 8/8
- Tickets auto-updated: 0 (devtrack binary not running)
- Estimated daily time saved: ~5 min (clear error path for standalone deployments)
- Blockers encountered: none
- One thing that still feels rough: "Build/vet/test commands cannot be fully verified on Windows due to Linux-only syscalls in cli.go and daemon.go — the project needs a Linux CI gate."
- Ready for PM review: YES

## 2026-04-23 — TASK-019: Ship features/loadEnvs to main

**Branch**: `features/loadEnvs`
**Commit**: `c1c05fa` — test(project-manager): isolate DB per test to fix test_find_related_projects
**PR**: https://github.com/sraj0501/automation_tools/pull/79

**What was built**:
The branch already contained two commits (`c8be0ea`): `loadenv.go` (AutoLoadEnv — auto .env
resolution and loading at daemon startup) and `setup.go` (devtrack setup onboarding wizard).
The only work needed was fixing the pre-existing test isolation failure before opening the PR.

**Root cause of test failure**:
`TestProjectManager` had zero DB isolation. `ProjectManager.__init__` calls `_load_from_db()`
which reads all rows from the shared SQLite file. After hundreds of prior test runs, 300+ WEB_APP
projects existed in the real devtrack.db. `find_related_projects(max_results=5)` returned the 5
highest-scoring old projects; the freshly created `project2` did not rank in the top 5 despite
having the same template type and description keyword overlap — because all 300+ others scored
equally high on both dimensions.

**Fix applied** (`backend/tests/test_project_manager.py`):
Added `isolate_db` autouse fixture to `TestProjectManager`. It uses `monkeypatch.setenv` to
point `DATABASE_DIR` at `tmp_path` before each test. Since `project_store._db_path()` reads
`config.database_path()` at call time (no module-level caching), the next `ProjectManager()`
instantiation picks up the fresh temp path and `_load_from_db()` finds zero rows.

**Test results**:
- `test_find_related_projects`: PASS (was FAIL)
- Full suite: 502 passed (was 501, 0 new failures)

**DevTrack commit**: used `devtrack git commit` — commit message accepted as-is (no AI
enhancement since daemon not running in this session context).

**Friction level**: LOW — root cause was obvious from the 300+ project IDs printed in debug
output. The fix is 13 lines of fixture, no production code changed.

## 2026-04-10 — TASK-016/017/018: CS-3 hardcoded-value audit (14 issues across 6 categories)

### TASK-016 — High: session cookie max_age + scrypt params
**Branch**: `fix/TASK-016-auth-hardcoded-values`
**Commit**: `25cec2f` — fix(admin): eliminate hardcoded scrypt params and session cookie max_age (TASK-016)
**PR**: https://github.com/sraj0501/automation_tools/pull/75

**What was built**:
- `get_admin_session_hours()` typed accessor in `config.py`; raises ValueError when unset; validates > 0
- `routes.py` login handler: `max_age=8 * 3600` replaced with `get_admin_session_hours() * 3600`
- `get_scrypt_n/r/p/dklen()` typed accessors in `config.py`; `get_scrypt_n()` validates power-of-2
- `auth.py`: module-level constants `_SCRYPT_N/R/P/DKLEN` sourced from the getters; both
  `hash_password()` and `verify_password()` use constants — no numeric literals remain
- `SCRYPT_N/R/P/DKLEN` added to `.env_sample` with explanatory comments
- `conftest.py`: `os.environ.setdefault` for all four SCRYPT vars + ADMIN_SESSION_HOURS so
  `auth.py` module-level constants resolve at test-suite import time
- 5 new tests in `TestScryptConfig`; suite: 497 passed (was 492)

**Friction level**: LOW — the tricky part was `auth.py`'s module-level constants reading env
vars at import time. Setting defaults in conftest.py before any import was the clean solution.

### TASK-017 — Medium: ports fallback + shutdown grace + HTMX intervals
**Branch**: `fix/TASK-017-medium-hardcoded-values`
**Commit**: `46f2cda` — fix(admin): eliminate medium-severity hardcoded values in routes, webhook, dashboard (TASK-017)
**PR**: https://github.com/sraj0501/automation_tools/pull/76

**What was built**:
- `_snapshot_ctx()` fallback uses `get_webhook_port()`/`get_admin_port()` with try/except → 0
- `get_shutdown_grace_period_seconds() -> float` in `config.py`; `webhook_server.py` timer uses it
- `get_stats_refresh_interval_seconds()` + `get_process_refresh_interval_seconds()` in `config.py`
- `dashboard()` route passes `stats_refresh_secs` and `process_refresh_secs` as template context;
  both wrapped in try/except with integer fallbacks (30/15) for robustness
- `dashboard.html` uses `{{ stats_refresh_secs }}s` and `{{ process_refresh_secs }}s`
- Three new vars in `.env_sample`; three new setdefault entries in `conftest.py`
- 1 new TestDashboard test confirming HTML renders env var value; suite: 497 passed (unchanged)

**Friction level**: LOW — monkeypatch.setenv + inline getter call (not import-time constant) means
the dashboard test is clean without module reloading.

### TASK-018 — Low: audit log limit + license email
**Branch**: `fix/TASK-018-low-hardcoded-values`
**Commit**: `c0c8a58` — fix(admin): eliminate low-severity hardcoded audit limit and license email (TASK-018)
**PR**: https://github.com/sraj0501/automation_tools/pull/77

**What was built**:
- `get_audit_log_limit() -> int` in `config.py`; routes.py audit page uses it; literal `200` gone
- `user_manager.get_audit_log()` default changed from `100` to `None`; when None, calls
  `get_audit_log_limit()` — both callers now draw from one config source
- `get_license_contact_email() -> str` in `config.py`; `_safe_license_email()` helper in routes.py
  wraps it with try/except falling back to the literal only if var is unset
- `license.html` uses `{{ license_email }}` — hardcoded address removed from template
- `AUDIT_LOG_LIMIT` and `LICENSE_CONTACT_EMAIL` in `.env_sample` + conftest.py defaults
- 3 new tests (audit limit raises when unset, returns value, license page renders configured email)
- Suite: 501 passed (was 497); pre-existing test_find_related_projects failure unchanged

**Friction level**: LOW

**Net result of all three tasks**: 14 hardcoded values eliminated, 11 new typed config accessors
added to `backend/config.py`, 9 new env vars in `.env_sample`, 9 new tests (total suite: 501).
All three PRs open and awaiting review.

## 2026-04-10 — TASK-011: Admin route HTTP tests

**Branch**: `features/TASK-011-admin-route-tests`
**Commit**: `12d268e` — test(admin-routes): add HTTP-level route tests for admin console (TASK-011)
**PR**: https://github.com/sraj0501/automation_tools/pull/69

**What was built**:
Created `backend/tests/test_admin_routes.py` — 31 HTTP-level tests using starlette
`TestClient` against the admin FastAPI app. Coverage:
- TestLogin (6): GET /admin/login returns 200 with form; POST valid creds → 303 + cookie;
  POST wrong/unknown/empty creds → 401
- TestLogout (2): authenticated logout clears cookie; unauthenticated → 303
- TestDashboard (3): authenticated 200; unauthenticated → 303; page contains "Dashboard"
- TestUsers (6): page 200/unauth; shows admin user; create user + DB verify; duplicate
  creation redirect with error; delete other user + DB verify; cannot delete self
- TestApiKeys (4): page 200/unauth; create key → new_key param in redirect; revoke key
  removed from DB
- TestServerPage (3): page 200/unauth; LLM section visible
- TestAuditPage (3): page 200/unauth; shows log entry written via db_dir.log_action
- TestPartials (3): /admin/_partials/processes 200/unauth/html fragment

**Key fixture design decisions**:
- `db_dir` fixture sets `DATABASE_DIR`, `DATA_DIR`, `ADMIN_USERNAME`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD` via
  `monkeypatch.setenv` and reloads `user_manager`. `check_credentials` reads env vars (not
  the DB), so the env vars are required for login POST tests to work.
- `get_snapshot` patched on `backend.admin.routes` in `client` fixture to prevent any
  psutil/subprocess/network calls.
- Audit event test writes directly via `db_dir.log_action()` — avoids cross-module-reload
  DB path ambiguity that arises when trying to verify via login POST.

**Test results**: 31/31 passed. Full suite: 464 passed (was 433), 1 pre-existing failure
unchanged (`test_find_related_projects`).

**Hardcoded scan**: CLEAN — no os.getenv in test file, all env vars via monkeypatch.

### [2026-04-05 ~session 4] TASK-009 — CS-2 server_tui headless tests

[DEVTRACK PAUSED — using raw git for this commit: daemon not running, missing .env vars]

**Original message I wrote**: "test(server-tui): add headless test coverage for server_tui helpers (TASK-009)"
**DevTrack enhanced it to**: N/A (DEVTRACK PAUSED)
**Ticket auto-linked**: NO
**PM system updated**: NO
**Time it took**: ~15 min (read 4 source files, wrote 660-line test file, 3 fix iterations)
**Friction level**: MEDIUM
**Notes**: Three test fixes required after first run (33/37 passing).
(1) AccessDenied/NoSuchProcess tests: production code's try/except is inside the
`for proc in psutil.process_iter(...)` loop body, not wrapping the iterator call
itself. Simulating those exceptions requires a mock whose `.info` property raises
(via a generator throw), not a side_effect on process_iter.
(2) Timestamp format mismatch: _query_stats() formats cutoff strings as
"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" (space, no Z) for SQL string comparison. Test rows inserted
with ISO-Z format ("...T...Z") produced incorrect string inequality comparisons.
Fixed _ts() helper to use space-separated format; ISO-Z/T formats are still tested
separately via literal timestamp strings in the parsing tests.
(3) URL-normalisation test: health_client.py imports get_webhook_port/get_webhook_host
inside the function body (lazy import). Patching at the module level fails with
AttributeError. Fixed by patching at backend.config source.
Platform caveat applied: all fixtures use pytest tmp_path (POSIX-safe), cmdlines use
generic "python3" strings, no macOS paths or service names. Test will pass unmodified
on Linux CI with Python 3.11+.
Pre-existing test failure (test_find_related_projects) confirmed unchanged.

### [2026-04-05 ~session 3] TASK-008 — CS-2 trigger throughput stats panel

[DEVTRACK PAUSED — using raw git for this commit: daemon not running, missing .env vars]

**Original message I wrote**: "feat(server-tui): add trigger throughput stats panel (TASK-008)"
**DevTrack enhanced it to**: N/A (DEVTRACK PAUSED)
**Ticket auto-linked**: NO
**PM system updated**: NO
**Time it took**: ~10 min (read DB schema in database.go, read app.py, write stats_client.py, 5 edits to app.py)
**Friction level**: LOW
**Notes**: The `triggers` table schema in database.go was clear — `trigger_type`, `timestamp`, `processed` columns were all I needed. There is no explicit `is_error` column, so I defined errors as unprocessed triggers older than 5 minutes (they should have been processed within seconds under normal operation). The `database_path()` helper in config.py already handles all the fallback logic (DATABASE_DIR, DATA_DIR, PROJECT_ROOT) so stats_client.py needed only one call. The smoke test returned real data from the existing DB (`last_trigger='17:25'`) confirming the SQL is correct. Pre-existing test failure (`test_find_related_projects`) unchanged.

### [2026-04-05 ~session 2] TASK-007 — Fix remaining os.getenv violations

[DEVTRACK PAUSED — using raw git for this commit: .env is a FIFO, daemon cannot start]

**Original message I wrote**: "fix(config): eliminate remaining os.getenv violations (TASK-007)"
**DevTrack enhanced it to**: N/A (DEVTRACK PAUSED)
**Ticket auto-linked**: NO
**PM system updated**: NO
**Time it took**: ~8 min (reading three files, adding one missing accessor, four edits)
**Friction level**: MEDIUM
**Notes**: health_client.py was already fixed by TASK-005 (only needed `import os` removal). webhook_server.py had two patterns: the generic `_cfg()`/`_cfg_bool()` fallback arms using os.getenv (replaced fallback with `return default` and `return default` since config=None means the server is non-functional anyway), plus direct `os.environ.get` calls in `_verify_trigger_key` and `main()` for the DEVTRACK_API_KEY and TLS vars (replaced with typed accessors). git_sage/agent.py needed a new try/except import block for `backend.config` mirroring the existing personalization import guard. One new accessor added to config.py: `get_webhook_gitlab_secret()`. Pre-existing test failure (`test_find_related_projects`) confirmed unchanged.

### [2026-04-05 SESSION] Config cleanup TASK-001 through TASK-006

[DEVTRACK PAUSED — using raw git for this session; daemon not running in this context]

**TASK-001 — Add missing config accessors**
**Original message I wrote**: "feat(config): add all missing config accessors and env_sample entries (TASK-001)"
**DevTrack enhanced it to**: N/A (DEVTRACK PAUSED)
**Ticket auto-linked**: NO
**PM system updated**: NO
**Time it took**: ~3 min (reading existing code, writing 50+ new functions, updating .env_sample)
**Friction level**: LOW
**Notes**: Config already well-structured with `get()`, `get_int()`, `get_bool()` helpers. Several functions already existed (mongodb_uri, github_token, etc.) — added get_-prefixed aliases as specified. Confirmed no duplicate env var reads.

---

### [2026-04-05 SESSION] TASK-002 — Fix os.getenv in backend/azure/

[DEVTRACK PAUSED — using raw git]

**Original message I wrote**: "fix(config): replace os.getenv in backend/azure/ and data_collectors (TASK-002)"
**DevTrack enhanced it to**: N/A
**Ticket auto-linked**: NO
**PM system updated**: NO
**Time it took**: ~5 min
**Friction level**: LOW
**Notes**: The `assignment_poller.py` fix was a clean simplification — config accessor already returns a list of ints, so the downstream string-splitting loop could be removed entirely.

---

### [2026-04-05 SESSION] TASK-003 — Fix os.getenv in backend/github/

[DEVTRACK PAUSED — using raw git]

**Original message I wrote**: "fix(config): replace os.getenv in backend/github/ and related modules (TASK-003)"
**DevTrack enhanced it to**: N/A
**Ticket auto-linked**: NO
**PM system updated**: NO
**Time it took**: ~5 min
**Friction level**: LOW
**Notes**: ghAnalysis.py had a try/except ImportError fallback pattern that made it look like os.getenv was needed. Removed the except branch since backend.config is always available. USER_NAME kept as os.getenv per spec (OS-level env var).

---

### [2026-04-05 SESSION] TASK-004 — Fix os.getenv in backend/gitlab/

[DEVTRACK PAUSED — using raw git]

**Original message I wrote**: "fix(config): replace os.getenv in backend/gitlab/ (TASK-004)"
**DevTrack enhanced it to**: N/A
**Ticket auto-linked**: NO
**PM system updated**: NO
**Time it took**: ~3 min
**Friction level**: LOW
**Notes**: Same patterns as azure/ — _env helper, check.py, sync.py, assignment_poller.py. Straightforward.

---

### [2026-04-05 SESSION] TASK-005 — Fix os.getenv in backend/admin/ and backend/server_tui/

[DEVTRACK PAUSED — using raw git]

**Original message I wrote**: "fix(config): replace os.getenv in backend/admin/ and backend/server_tui/ (TASK-005)"
**DevTrack enhanced it to**: N/A
**Ticket auto-linked**: NO
**PM system updated**: NO
**Time it took**: ~5 min
**Friction level**: MEDIUM
**Notes**: admin/routes.py required careful handling — the config dict literal had to have imports placed before it, not inside it (initial edit put `from` inside the dict which would be a syntax error). Caught and fixed immediately. admin/server_status.py needed module-level aliased imports since it reads config at snapshot time.

---

### [2026-04-05 SESSION] TASK-006 — Fix os.getenv in remaining modules

[DEVTRACK PAUSED — using raw git]

**Original message I wrote**: "fix(config): replace os.getenv in remaining modules (TASK-006)"
**DevTrack enhanced it to**: N/A
**Ticket auto-linked**: NO
**PM system updated**: NO
**Time it took**: ~12 min (18 files)
**Friction level**: MEDIUM
**Notes**: rag/embedder.py was satisfying — removed the entire fallback `except Exception: return "http://localhost:11434"` since ollama_host() already has a sensible default in config.py. telegram/handlers.py had 5 separate violations across different functions. Two remaining violations found (webhook_server.py, git_sage/agent.py) are outside the 6-task scope.

---

## Daily Summary — 2026-04-05

- Commits made: 6 (TASK-001 through TASK-006)
- Tickets auto-updated: 0 (DEVTRACK PAUSED — daemon not running in this context)
- Estimated time saved vs manual updates: ~0 min (no PM sync possible without daemon)
- Standup content generated: NO
- Most interesting AI enhancement: N/A (all raw git this session)
- One thing that still feels rough: Two remaining violations (webhook_server.py L359/365/374/856-858, git_sage/agent.py L31) are out of scope for this sprint. Worth a TASK-007 to clean them up.

**Pre-existing test failure noted**: `test_find_related_projects` in test_project_manager.py fails before and after all changes — confirmed pre-existing, not introduced by this work.
